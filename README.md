# CarInfo
Used for reading data from a mystery cable found in my car that turned out to be an EGT sensor :D
It creates a web server for displaying EGT and EGT sensor voltage. I might add more stuff in the future.

## Usefull stuff:
### [Wiring diagram](https://esp32.com/download/file.php?id=1205&sid=b2a025eb132bba33aadf4628eb28b5c8) for increasing the voltage by 100 mV due to ESP32 ADC limitation
### Typical [voltage output](https://www.omega.com/en-us/resources/k-type-thermocouples) for the K type Thermocouple
